App::Codeowners::Formatter - Base class for formatting codeowners output

=head1 VERSION

version 0.42

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $formatter = App::Codeowners::Formatter->new(handle => *STDOUT);
    $formatter->add_result($_) for @results;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a base class for formatters. A formatter is a class that takes data records, stringifies
them, and prints them to an IO handle.

This class is mostly abstract, though it is also usable as a null formatter where results are simply
discarded if it is instantiated directly. These other formatters do more interesting things:

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 handle

Get the IO handle associated with a formatter.

=head2 format

Get the format string, which may be used to customize the formatting.

=head2 columns

Get an arrayref of column headings.

=head2 results

Get an arrayref of all the results that have been provided to the formatter using L</add_result> but
have not yet been formatted.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    $formatter = App::Codeowners::Formatter->new;
    $formatter = App::Codeowners::Formatter->new(%attributes);

Construct a new formatter.

=head2 DESTROY

Destructor calls L</finish>.

=head2 add_result

    $formatter->add_result($result);

Provide an additional lint result to be formatted.

=head2 start

    $formatter->start;

Begin formatting results. Called before any results are passed to the L</stream> method.

This method may print a header to the L</handle>. This method is used by subclasses and should
typically not be called explicitly.

=head2 stream

    $formatter->stream(\@result, ...);

Format one result.

This method is expected to print a string representation of the result to the L</handle>. This
method is used by subclasses and should typically not called be called explicitly.

The default implementation simply stores the L</results> so they will be available to L</finish>.

=head2 finish

    $formatter->finish;

End formatting results. Called after all results are passed to the L</stream> method.

This method may print a footer to the L</handle>. This method is used by subclasses and should
typically not be called explicitly.

=head2 formatters

    @formatters = App::Codeowners::Formatter->formatters;

Get a list of package names of potential formatters within the C<App::Codeowners::Formatter>
namespace.
